## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the playbook file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly efficient, in addition to restricting traffic to the network.
- What aspect of security do load balancers protect? 
Mitigates DoS attacks, load balancers help protect the availability of resources by ensuring that no single server has to handle too much traffic. 

- What is the advantage of a jump box?
The advantage of a jump box is to give access to admins to a secure computer to connect to before conducting any administrative tasks/assignments
Jump box provides a gateway to access other machines on a private network using SSH protocol.


Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the data and system logs.
- What does Filebeat watch for?
Filebeat watches and logs any changes in file systems and when they happened

- What does Metricbeat record?
Metricbeat records metrics and statistics from the OS and services running on the server, then ships them to the output specified.


The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name      | Function        | IP Address | Operating System |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|------------------|
| JumpBox   | Gateway         | 10.0.0.5   | Linux Ubuntu     |
| Web-1     | Virtual Machine | 10.0.0.6   | Linux Ubuntu     |
| Web-2     | Virtual Machine | 10.0.0.7   | Linux Ubuntu     |
| Web-3     | Virtual Machine | 10.0.0.10  | Linux Ubuntu     |
| Web-4 ELK | ELK Server      | 10.1.0.4   | Linux Ubuntu     |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the JumpBox virtual machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- Add whitelisted IP addresses: Public IP address 108.56.133.74

Machines within the network can only be accessed by SSH.

- Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP address? JumpBox virtual machine, private IP of ELK VM is 10.1.0.4

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name      | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Address    |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| JumpBox   | Yes                 | Laptop IPv4           |
| Web-1     | No                  | 10.0.0.5              |
| Web-2     | No                  | 10.0.0.5              |
| Web-3     | No                  | 10.0.0.5              |
| Web-4 ELK | Yes                 | Laptop IPv4, 10.0.0.5 |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?
This allows to use one playbook to scale up and deploy to multiple servers

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Install docker.io, Python3-pip, docker module
- Increase virtual memory with command: sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
- Download and launch docker ELK container (image: seep/elk:761 and published ports: 5601, 9200, 5044)
- Enable service docker on boot

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
Web-1 ip: 10.0.0.6
Web-2 ip: 10.0.0.7
Web-3 ip: 10.0.0.10

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeat
- Metricbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat: collects and organizes log files, including files that have changed and when. These files come from Apache server and MySQL database logs generated by DVWA. 

- Metricbeat: helps monitor your servers by collecting metrics data from the operating system and services running on the server such as Apache.

E.g., Topbeat: helps monitor servers by collecting: 
System wide statistics (CPU usage, memory usage, etc)
Per-process statistics (process name, process pid, process state, etc)
File system statistics (list of available disks, etc)

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the filebeat-configuration.yml file to /etc/ansible/files/filebeat-configuration.yml
- Update the host file to include web servers and elk server ip addresses
- Run the playbook, and navigate to http://104.45.228.107:5601/app/kibana to check that the installation worked as expected.

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
Use command: ansible-playbok [name of nano .yml file]
